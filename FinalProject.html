        <p> Hello _____! In order to start this game, you will first need to
        understand how it is played. This is meant to be a user interactive game,
        meaning you, the user, will have to do some things for this to work out.
        Troublesome, I know, but it should be fun and you should like it. Anyways,
        these "things" that you will have to do might not be the same. The main
        objective of the game is to answer questions to go on to the next step.</p>
    </div>
    <div style = "float: right; width: 54%">
    <p> Now, just to be on the same page, there is a clear div tag placed
        here to separate this and the other column.</p>
